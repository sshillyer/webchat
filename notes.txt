Ideas: WebSockets library?


# Setting up:
Install node.js
Install typescript globally on machine:
	npm install -g typescript

	ERROR: Wants node 4.2.0+, only have installed node 2.10.1

Make project and npm init once in

Set up a git ignore file for the project

If using websockets libary, install it & update packages.json using
	npm install --save ws

Make sure our compiled JS goes into a /build folder
TS goes into /src
/declarations --> used to declare third party modules. There are some available at DefinitelyTyped project page (https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped)




# Data model
Don't need DB, running in-memory
Can set up a data model as a close:


class Message {
	user: string;
	message: string;

	
}
